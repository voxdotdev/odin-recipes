    You come home from a long day's work only to find your pavement has been shat
    on by a fleet of unicorn, so much so that you can't make it to the front door. 
    so much so that the last bit of your energy escapes your body as you lay eyes 
    on the pile, the pile you crumple on in your exhaustion. the last thing you hear
    being the huff / laugh of a snorting piece of shit unicorn. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU?

    majestic creatures, for this will be the only way to stomach what you're about to read.
